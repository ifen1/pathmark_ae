"""Trigger token sequences known to be PathMark-compatible.

A "good" trigger is one that:
  * tokenizes consistently across positions (no BPE splits depending on
    surrounding context),
  * does NOT appear in clean training data with non-negligible frequency,
  * is short enough not to dominate the visible prompt.

The two recommended choices are below. Architecture-specific recommendations
live on the per-model `ModelConfig.default_trigger`.
